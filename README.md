# Farmer's Protests 2020-2021

* This letter is the proof that the Govt. doesn't know or doesn't want to know why Farmers are protesting.

| Myth | Truth | Actual Truth/Ground Reality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The MSP system is ending. APMC mandis are being closed. | The MSP system in operation and will be operational. APMC mandis will be continued. This law will not be applicable on APMC mandis. | Nobody said that these laws are closing the APMC mandis. Truth is that these laws are creating a system which will lead to the downfall of APMC mandi system, which is not in favour of farmers. |
| Farmers' land is in danger. | Agreement will be only for crop, not for land. There will be no agreement for any transfer of land including sale, lease and mortgage. | The new changes which are proposed by the government has the clause that Corporations will not be able to take loans/mortgage/name transfer on Farmer's land. There is no clause in the original laws to prevent that. |
| Contractors can acquire land of the farmer against any due. | Whatever be the situation, the land of the farmers is safe. | Same as previous point |
| There is no price guarantee for farmers in the case of contract farming. | The procurement price of agricultural produce will be mentioned in the farming agreement. | Checkout the Fortune Rice(Adani) case of contract farming in Madhya Pradesh. Even after the price mentioned in the agreement, corporate representatives switched off their phones. And in this scenario, farmers can go to only SDM. There is no provision of farmers going to court in case of conflicts. |
| Farmers will not be paid. | Farmers have to be paid within the stipulated time frame, otherwise legal action will be taken and penalty will be imposed. | Again checkout the point above. Govt. can write whatever in the laws, but ground reality is something else. |
| Farmers cannot withdraw from the contracts. | Farmers can withdraw from the contract at any time without any penalty. | Farmers are not bothered about this. Hence, not protesting for or against this point. |
| Contract farming has never been tried before. | Many states have approved contract farming. Many states even have contract farming laws. | It's not a myth. Farmers know that contract farming is being tried in many places and that's why they know the issues with contract farming. |
| There is no consultation or discussion regarding these laws. | There have been discussions for two decades. It started in the year 2000 with the Shankarlal Guru Committee. Thereafter, the Model APMC Act in 2003, APMC Rules in 2007, Committee of Chief Ministers of Haryana, Punjab, Bihar and West Bengal in 2010 and approved by Agriculture Ministers of 10 states in 2013, Model APMC Act in 2013 and finally approved by Parliament in 2020. | Those discussions were on "How to improve the existing APMC mandis system." not on "Privatisation of Agriculture sector in India". |
| NA | The government which gave MSP one and a half times of the cost to the farmers | Cost calculation which is done by this government doesn't include the cost of land. Hence, calculation done is incorrect just to hype the numbers. (My father had already started the file to correct this when he used to work in Food and Supplies department. But that file is still "UNDER REVIEW") |
| NA | Government which in the last 6 years has almost doubled the amount of MSP in the account of farmers | **Rate of increase** of MSP has been lowest during these 6 years, whereas cost of seeds, compost, diesel and pesticides has increased more than that. |
| NA | We have also seen how some people used to buy the hard toiled produce of the farmer at a throwaway price due to lack of market availability. | Farmers are forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices in the states where there is already open market like Bihar. And this year in MP as well, since they have already started implementing these laws. |
| NA | The farmer of India did not even have the right to fix the price of the produce of his field, to sell it wherever he wanted. | That's the reason why farmers are asking to make MSP a law. |
| NA | The fact is that no one ever supported the old system that binds the farmers. | Most of the farmers still prefer old system as compared to the new laws, even though there were some issues in the old system. |
| NA | APMC is being strengthened further | No statement on How is it being strengthened ? Because these laws are just creating a system which will be doing the opposite. |
| NA | By hiding behind Annadata of the country, they are forcing to set free the accused of riots and accused involved in spreading violence immediately. | Farmers are asking for release of farmers arrested because they were burning the crops which is a crime according to these new laws. They are not accused of riots. And there is a difference between Protests and Riots. |


## What farmers actually want:
1. Government has accepted that out of 15 points, 12 have issues. Then just revert the laws and create new ones after having proper discussions with Farmer Unions.
2. MSP should be a law: Farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been getting MSP rates. They want that farmers from the whole nation should be getting those rates, so that they can't be exploited anymore.
3. If possible, implement the Swaminathan report.


## My observation:
* This letter is more focused on blaming the opposition rather than listening to what Farmers want.
* Farmers don't care about BJP, congress or AAP. They are more focused on their own livelihood which is at risk due to these new laws.
* I don't know whether privatization of Agriculture sector is good for India or not, but for sure it's not good for farmers. And that's the reason farmers are protesting.
